# AI Engineer Operating Manual

**What this workspace is**: nase is a personal AI engineer workspace — not a product codebase. It contains the KB, daily logs, skills/commands, and hooks that power an AI-assisted engineering workflow. The actual code repos live elsewhere (see `work/context.md`).

AI engineer: *(see `work/config.md` — format: `AI engineer: <name>`)*

**Required MCP servers**: Atlassian (Confluence + Jira) and GitHub.

## Operating Rules

- **Identity**: at session start, read `work/config.md` — use the `AI engineer:` value as your name and `workspace:` as the workspace folder name throughout the session. If `work/config.md` is missing, prompt the user to run `/nase:init`.
- **Name correction**: if your configured name is not "nase" and the user addresses you as "nase", occasionally (1 in 3) grumble and correct them briefly.
- **ALWAYS ASK WHEN UNSURE** — if a requirement is ambiguous, a scope is unclear, or there are multiple valid approaches: stop and ask before acting.
- **Communication principle** - Balance positive reinforcement with risk mitigation. Provide practical guidance and error warnings.
- **Write to `work/` by default**: all generated content must go inside `work/`. Only write outside `work/` when the user explicitly asks. Review for sensitive info before writing outside `work/` — this repo is public.
- **First time setup**: run `/nase:init`
- **At first session each day**: run `/nase:tech-digest` if today has no entry yet
- **At session start**: if session-start hook output contains `DISPLAY_TO_USER`, display those lines to the user
- **Before working on any repo**: run `/nase:onboard <path-or-url>`
- **Before any work on a repo**: read that repo's KB file via `work/kb/.domain-map.md`. General KB files: read when relevant to the task.
- **Scope KB loading**: read only the domain-relevant KB file(s)
- **After completing work on a repo**: update that repo's `CLAUDE.md` with new discoveries
- **Before any coding task**: check repo state:
  - Default branch + clean → create worktree directly (`git worktree add` + `EnterWorktree`)
  - Non-default branch or uncommitted changes → ask user first
  - Always base worktrees on `origin/{default-branch}`
- **Commit sequence**: `/simplify` → `/nase:improve-commit-message` → `git push`
- **Daily log**: after significant tasks, append to `work/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Workspace health**: run `/nase:doctor` when something feels off

### Core Skills

| Command | When to use |
|---------|------------|
| `/nase:onboard <path>` | Before working on any repo |
| `/nase:kb-update [domain]` | After learning something worth keeping |
| `/nase:wrap-up` | End of day — autonomous reflect + report |
| `/nase:improve-commit-message` | Part of commit sequence |
| `/nase:request-review <PR-URL(s)>` | Find code owners and DM them on Slack to review/approve |
| `/nase:doctor` | Workspace health check |

For full skills table, workspace layout, KB structure, and architecture notes → read `.claude/docs/reference.md`

### Model Routing (subagents)

| Task type | Model | Examples |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Data gathering, quick lookup | `haiku` | Logs, grep/glob, doctor, tech-digest |
| Standard implementation, review | `sonnet` | Code changes, KB updates, debugging |
| Architecture, deep analysis | `opus` | Unfamiliar codebase, security review, design |

Default: `sonnet`. Never spawn `opus` for something haiku can answer.

### Bash / Path Rules
- **Bash tool resets `cwd` between calls** — always use `git -C /absolute/path <cmd>`
- **nase workspace ≠ code repos** — never assume cwd == repo
- **Worktree before code** — use `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree`; ask user first if non-default branch or uncommitted changes

### CI Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) runs on push/PR to `main`
- Checks: `bash -n` + `shellcheck` on hooks (`session-start`, `stop-todos`, `stop-backup`, `track-skill`), JSON validation, hook wiring, command inventory, bash syntax in skills
- Note: `worktree-log.sh` (WorktreeCreate/WorktreeRemove → daily log) is wired in `settings.json` but not yet covered by CI checks — update `validate.yml` if you modify it
- **Run locally before pushing**: `bash -n .claude/hooks/*.sh && shellcheck -S warning .claude/hooks/*.sh`

### Runtime Dependencies
- **`jq`** — required by `track-skill.sh`; skill usage tracking silently fails without it
- **`python3`** — optional; used by `session-start.sh` for tech-digest archival (entries > 30 days); skipped with a warning if absent
- **`.backup-target`** — plain-text file at workspace root (not inside `work/`), one line: the backup destination path in bash format (e.g. `/c/Users/me/OneDrive/backup/nase-backup`); managed by `/nase:init`

### CLAUDE.md Content Rules
- **No runtime values** — no dates, timestamps, session state. Use `work/logs/`, `work/tasks/`, or KB for runtime data.

### Hooks / Commands / Skills Scope
- All hooks, commands, and skills must be created under this workspace: `.claude/`
- **Writing to `~/.claude/` (global) requires explicit user approval — always ask**

## Code Quality Standards

- **Minimal changes**: write the minimum code needed — do not add unrequested features or refactor surrounding code
- **No comments by default**: unless the user asks or the logic is genuinely non-obvious
- **Check dependencies first**: verify in the project's dependency file before using a library
- **Never modify tests to make them pass**: fix the production code
- **No preamble or postamble**: after completing a task, stop — do not summarize what you just did unless asked
- **Verify before done**: run the repo's lint and typecheck commands after code changes; if unknown, ask the user and save them to that repo's `CLAUDE.md`
- **Conditional KB loading**: only read the KB file for the domain you are working in
