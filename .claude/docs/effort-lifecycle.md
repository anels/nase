# Effort Lifecycle

Shared rules for `workspace/efforts/{slug}.md` and related `todo.md` entries.
Callers own inferring the slug; this doc owns status names and lifecycle edits.

All full-file writes use `.claude/docs/workspace-write-guard.md` and
`workspace-write-guard.py`. Auto-write modes only skip human confirmation; they
never skip final drift checks.

## Status Vocabulary

Frontmatter `status:` for `workspace/efforts/{slug}.md`. This is the authoritative
list; `/nase:kb-review` Step 4d validates against it.

**Active** (file lives directly in `workspace/efforts/`):

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `planned` | design approved, implementation not started |
| `in-progress` | implementation underway (set by `/nase:fsd`) |
| `needs-revision` | PR open but review/CI sent it back for changes |
| `blocked` | progress halted on an external dependency |
| `merge-ready` | review passed, awaiting human merge (set by `/nase:prep-merge`) |
| `awaiting-deploy` | PR merged; awaiting deploy + post-deploy validation before close |
| `tracked` | tracking-only effort someone else implements |
| `ready` | reserved alias for `merge-ready`/`planned`-complete states |

**Done** (file moved to `workspace/efforts/done/`):

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `completed` | shipped and verified |
| `wontfix` | closed without shipping |

`awaiting-deploy` has no automatic setter — set it by hand (or via `/nase:today`)
when the PR merges, paired with `- [x] Merged` in the Lifecycle block. The effort
moves to `done/` + `completed` only after deploy validation passes.

## Dependency & Discovery Fields

Two optional frontmatter keys make dependencies first-class instead of prose buried
in the body, so `/nase:efforts` can compute an unblocked-work view without parsing
each doc body. Both are optional — omit when not applicable.

| field | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `blocked-by` | effort slug, PR URL, Jira key, or short free text | this effort cannot proceed until the referent clears |
| `discovered-from` | effort slug, PR URL, or incident/ticket ref | this effort was spun off while working the referent (captures work that would otherwise be noticed and lost) |

`blocked-by` may be a single value or a YAML list. Clearing the blocker: remove the
key (or set `status:` off `blocked`). A blocker counts resolved when an effort slug is
in `done/`, a PR is merged, or a Jira issue is Done. Short free text has no resolver,
so it stays unresolved until removed.

**Computed "unblocked" view** (read-only, no stored field): an active effort is
*unblocked* when `status:` is not `blocked` **and** it has no unresolved `blocked-by`.
This is distinct from the `ready` status token above (which is a manual alias). Callers
must compute unblocked from `status` + `blocked-by`, never store it.

## Single-File Invariant

One effort = one file: `workspace/efforts/{slug}.md`. Do **not** spawn per-phase
sidecar files (`{slug}-phase-2.md`, `{slug}-plan-v3.md`, etc.) — that is the failure
mode that decays into hundreds of orphan plan files. All phase progress appends to the
single doc: check the `## Lifecycle` boxes, add `phase_*_pr:` frontmatter pointers for
per-phase PRs, and append notes in-place. A restarting agent re-reads the one doc rather
than reconstructing intent from a pile of stale siblings.

## Design Creation

Used by `/nase:design` Phase 5.

Create `workspace/efforts/{slug}.md` with:

```yaml
---
status: planned
created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
scope: {quick-fix|feature|initiative|exploration}
repo: {repo-name or "multiple"}
---
```

Initial lifecycle:

```markdown
## Lifecycle
- [x] Design approved — {YYYY-MM-DD}
- [ ] Implementation started
- [ ] PR opened
- [ ] Review passed
- [ ] Merged
- [ ] Deployed (if applicable)
```

Append a matching pending task to `workspace/tasks/todo.md`:

```markdown
- [ ] **{Title}** — {one-line summary} -> `workspace/efforts/{slug}.md`
```

## FSD Update

Used by `/nase:fsd` Phase 8b when `$ARGUMENTS` contains a slug matching
`workspace/efforts/{slug}.md`.

- `- [ ] Implementation started` -> `- [x] Implementation started — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
- `- [ ] PR opened` -> `- [x] PR opened — {PR URL or branch_name}` when a PR or branch exists
- Frontmatter `status:` -> `in-progress`

Skip silently if no slug can be inferred.

## Prep-Merge Update

Used by `/nase:prep-merge` after the PR branch is prepared and reviewer comments
are resolved.

- `- [ ] Review passed` -> `- [x] Review passed — {YYYY-MM-DD}`
- Frontmatter `status:` -> `merge-ready`

Do not mark `Merged`; actual merge is a human action on GitHub.

## Wrap-Up Read Path

`/nase:wrap-up` may summarize active efforts but should not invent lifecycle
state. If it needs to fix stale lifecycle fields, it follows this doc and the
workspace write guard.
