A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) workspace for AI-assisted engineering across multiple repos: repo memory, workflow commands, lifecycle hooks, daily logs, and backups.

> **Name origin**:
> **nase** can mean ***N***ot ***A*** ***S***oftware ***E***ngineer, ***N***ot ***A***I ***S***oftware ***E***ngineer, or the recursive ***N***ase is an ***A***ssistant for ***S***oftware ***E***ngineer. It also sounds like 那谁 (*nà shuí*) in Chinese — "hey, whatsyourname".

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anels/nase.git my-workspace
cd my-workspace
claude                        # open Claude Code in this directory
```

Then inside Claude Code:

```
/nase:init                    # set AI name, configure backup & language, create workspace/
/nase:onboard /path/to/repo   # onboard a repo (local path or GitHub URL)
/nase:onboard                 # refresh ALL already-onboarded repos from workspace/context.md
/nase:today                   # morning kickoff — what to focus on today
```

Run `/nase:help` anytime for the full command overview.

Optionally, add a shell alias to launch nase from anywhere:

<details>
<summary>bash / zsh (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)</summary>

```bash
# Claude Code — nase workspace (adjust path to your clone location)
nase() { cd ~/my-workspace && claude "$@"; }
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>PowerShell ($PROFILE)</summary>

```powershell
# Claude Code — nase workspace (adjust path to your clone location)
function Invoke-NaseClaude { Set-Location "$HOME\my-workspace"; claude @args }
Set-Alias -Name nase -Value Invoke-NaseClaude
```

</details>

Then run `nase` from any terminal to open Claude Code in the workspace.

> **Tip**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` auto-approves tool calls but removes Claude Code's confirmation layer. Keep it off unless you trust the local hooks and tests.

### Prerequisites

- **[Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — required
- **Git** — required for hooks and report commands
- **[GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/)** — required for PR metadata, diffs, reviews, and PR creation workflows
- **7z or zip + unzip** — required for backups and restore; install via `scoop install 7zip` or `brew install p7zip`
- **jq** — required by hooks that parse Claude Code tool-call JSON (`block-dangerous-git.sh`, external-write guards, `track-skill.sh`)
- **python3** — required by date-range helpers used in recap/stats/KB-gap flows; also used for tech-digest archival of entries older than 30 days

#### Recommended agent CLI tools

These are optional. nase still runs without them; `/nase:doctor` reports missing
tools as warnings so skills can fall back cleanly.

Baseline macOS install:

```bash
brew install ripgrep fd yq shellcheck shfmt
```

Useful daily add-ons:

```bash
brew install ast-grep gitleaks difftastic duckdb ccusage
```

Generate task-specific availability and Homebrew install commands:

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/tool-availability.py --all --format table
python3 .claude/scripts/tool-availability.py --all --missing --install brew
```

Narrow tools such as `actionlint`, `semgrep`, `trivy`, `lychee`, `hadolint`,
`rga`, `qsv`, `http`, `grpcurl`, `markitdown`, `pandoc`, `poppler`, `qpdf`,
`magick`, and `hyperfine` are detectable by `/nase:doctor --deep`; install them
only when a workflow needs that evidence. Python-package tools such as
`markitdown` may show a non-Homebrew install hint in the availability table;
`--install brew` only prints Homebrew-installable formulas. Selection rules live
in `.claude/docs/cli-tooling.md`.

#### MCP servers

| MCP | Used for | Setup |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Atlassian** (Confluence + Jira) | `/nase:onboard` reads Confluence docs; Jira ticket lookup in reports | [Atlassian MCP](https://github.com/atlassian/mcp-atlassian) |
| **Slack** | `/nase:request-review` — resolves GitHub handles to Slack users and stages DM drafts; direct sends are blocked by a hook | [Slack MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/slack) |
| **Codex** | Optional read-only second-opinion gates; skipped cleanly when unavailable | `claude mcp add codex --scope user -- /Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex mcp-server` |

Configure MCP servers in your Claude Code `settings.json` (or `settings.local.json`) under `mcpServers`. GitHub workflows use `gh` CLI by default.

## What nase is

A personal AI engineering workbench for Claude Code. It is organized like a
small kernel around Claude Code: Markdown commands define workflows, lifecycle
hooks gate risky tool calls, scripts provide deterministic checks, and
`workspace/` holds human-readable state.

- **Human-readable memory** — `workspace/kb/projects/<repo>.md` plus shared `workspace/kb/general/`; `/nase:onboard` populates them and tasks load only relevant files instead of dumping the whole repo into context.
- **30+ Markdown commands** — daily kickoff, onboarding, design, implementation, PR review, KB hygiene, wrap-up. See [Available commands](#available-commands).
- **Lifecycle hooks** — block destructive git and guard high-risk external writes, back up `workspace/`, log `/nase:*` usage, and run validation helpers. See [Hooks at a glance](#hooks-at-a-glance).
- **Evidence loops** — PR/review/audit commands require repo evidence, focused tests, explicit AI-provenance checks where relevant, and optional read-only Codex checks when configured.
- **Offline PR evals** — `evals/pr-review/` contains deterministic output-shape checks for high-frequency PR/review and audit workflows.

`workspace/` content persists locally and is auto-backed-up. The kit (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`) lives in git; your content stays local.

Architecture details live in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

Run the PR/review eval schema check locally:

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/pr-review-eval.py validate evals/pr-review/evals.json
```

### Design principles

- **Deterministic guardrails beat prompt promises.** Prompt rules describe intent; hooks and tests enforce the dangerous edges: protected-branch pushes, destructive git, direct Slack sends, Jira mutations, oversized Confluence writes, and shell-script regressions.
- **Context is sliced, not dumped.** Commands read repo KB, domain maps, GitHub metadata, focused diffs, and script-filtered logs before pulling more files into context.
- **Knowledge stays reviewable.** Durable memory is plain Markdown under `workspace/kb/`, `workspace/tasks/`, `workspace/skills/`, and `workspace/journals/`; humans can inspect, edit, delete, and share it.
- **Review claims need evidence.** PR and audit workflows should back findings with source paths, diffs, tests, logs, or `gh`/`rg`/`ast-grep` output, then drop candidates that cannot be verified.
- **External writes stay human-triggered.** Slack uses drafts, Jira writes require a short-lived token after approval, Confluence writes are size-guarded, and GitHub review posting happens only after explicit instruction.
- **Skills are files.** New workflow behavior should live as a command, shared doc, script, hook, or eval case, not as hidden state in one conversation.

---

## Use cases

### Your daily workflow

- `/nase:today` syncs PR/Jira status and plans focus; `/nase:wrap-up` captures learnings.
- `/nase:reflect` extracts fresh task lessons; wrap-up rolls them into KB updates and reusable skills.
- Hooks create daily logs and append commit summaries; `/nase:recap` turns them into reports.

```
/nase:today                    # morning: sync statuses, surface priorities, plan focus
/nase:onboard                  # refresh repo context for the day
  focused work                  # implement, review PRs, debug — whatever's on the list
/nase:reflect                  # after completing a task: extract learnings while fresh
  ... more work ...
/nase:wrap-up                  # evening: reflect → learn → extract-skills → kb-update → journal
```

### Implement a feature or fix

- `/nase:design` handles complex tasks: KB context, 2–3 approaches, tradeoffs, tracked effort doc. Skip it for simple fixes.
- `/nase:fsd` handles code → test → fix → commit → push → draft PR. For large features use **Direct with Phase isolation**; for hard TDD use **Yes** at the TDD prompt.
- Optional Codex second-opinion gates run where configured and skip their Codex call cleanly otherwise; `/nase:fsd` and `/nase:address-comments` still run their local read-only verifier fallback for pre-push and review-thread safety.
- Reviewer discovery uses KB → git history → CODEOWNERS, then stages Slack DM drafts.
- Review feedback is handled interactively: obvious fixes applied, ambiguous comments discussed one by one.

```
/nase:onboard <repo>          # load repo context into KB
/nase:design <task>            # (complex tasks) explore approaches → effort doc
  review and iterate             # discuss tradeoffs, refine until approved
  /nase:design --grill <slug>    # (optional) stress-test the plan one question at a time
/nase:fsd <task>               # implement → test → commit → push → draft PR
/nase:request-review <PR-URL>  # find right reviewers, stage Slack DM drafts
  ⏳ wait for feedback
/nase:address-comments <PR-URL> # deep-dive each unresolved comment → fix/reply → push → resolve threads
  ⏳ iterate until approved
/nase:prep-merge <PR-URL>      # rebase, squash, clean up, un-draft
  merge ✓
```

### Review someone else's PR

- Loads repo KB, Confluence context, and git history before drafting comments.
- Runs architecture, bugs, security, testability, and DRY/KISS passes, then synthesizes findings.
- Confirmed findings can be captured into KB. Inline comments are drafts until you ask to post.

```
/nase:onboard <repo>           # ensure KB is fresh for this repo
/nase:discuss-pr <PR-URL>      # deep analysis — architecture, bugs, security, patterns
                               #   produces inline comment drafts in chat
  review and edit drafts         # discuss findings, adjust comments
  post to GitHub when ready      # nase posts only on your explicit instruction
```

### Build and share knowledge

- Capture lessons, articles, and patterns into durable KB files.
- `/nase:extract-skills` turns repeated workflows into workspace-local commands.
- `/nase:kb-review` deduplicates, cross-references, and prunes stale entries.
- `/nase:kb-teamshare` exports sanitized KB + skills; teammates import with `/nase:kb-merge`.

```
/nase:learn <url-or-tip>       # capture an article, technique, or lesson
/nase:kb-update                # persist session learnings into KB
/nase:extract-skills           # analyze session → extract reusable patterns as workspace skills
/nase:kb-review                # periodically: deduplicate, cross-reference, clean up stale entries
/nase:kb-teamshare             # export sanitized KB + skills for teammates
/nase:kb-merge <path>          # import a teammate's shared KB into your workspace
```

### Track progress and report

- `/nase:recap` generates weekly/monthly summaries from logs, commits, and task completions.
- `/nase:estimate-eta` gives calibrated estimates from KB + history.
- `/nase:stats` shows skill/workspace activity from hook-collected data.

## Hooks at a glance

Hooks run on Claude Code lifecycle events. `PreToolUse:Bash` rejects known destructive git patterns before execution: direct or wrapped `git reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`, unsafe alias injection, hook/signing bypass flags, protected-branch pushes to any remote, and remote branch deletion. This is defense-in-depth, not a full shell sandbox.

External-write hooks block direct Slack sends, require a fresh prompted Jira write token, and stop oversized Confluence page writes before they can truncate. Use Slack drafts, explicit Jira confirmation, or a `workspace/tmp/` Confluence patch when those guards fire.

Other hooks: `SessionStart` creates today's log and reports backup status; `UserPromptSubmit` nudges `[STYLE-DELTA]` capture for style corrections and records slash commands; `Stop` backs up `workspace/`; `PostToolUse:Skill` logs `/nase:*`; `PreToolUse:Edit|Write|MultiEdit` fact-forces the first source-file edit per session; `PostToolUse:Edit|Write` shellchecks edited `.sh`; worktree removal logs lifecycle; `PreCompact` rotates old lessons/efforts.

Full table with behavior details: [`docs/architecture.md` — Hooks that gate tool calls](docs/architecture.md#hooks-that-gate-tool-calls).

The `Stop` hook reads `backup-target` from `.local-paths` (set by `/nase:init`). If the file doesn't exist, the hook silently skips.

## Workspace structure

```
nase/
  .claude/             kit — subagents, slash commands, hooks, scripts, settings (tracked; local settings/skills and generated wrappers ignored)
  docs/                deeper docs (architecture, internals)
  tests/               CI gates
  CLAUDE.md            AI identity + operating rules (tracked)
  README.md            this file
  .local-paths         machine-specific paths — backup target, repo paths (not tracked)
  workspace/           your content — KB, logs, journals, skills, tasks (not tracked)
```

| Path | In git? | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| `.claude/`, `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `tests/` | Yes, except `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.claude/commands/nase/workspace/` | Shared kit + docs; local settings/skills and generated wrappers stay local |
| `.local-paths` | No | Machine-specific paths |
| `workspace/` | No | Per-user content |

Full layout (kit + `workspace/`): [`docs/architecture.md` — Workspace layout](docs/architecture.md#workspace-layout).

---

## Configuration

The kit is tracked by git; `workspace/` is ignored and stays local. `git pull` updates only kit files.

**Customizing for your stack:**

- Add KB domains: create `workspace/kb/general/<domain>.md` and edit `workspace/kb/.domain-map.md`
- Add a repo: `/nase:onboard <path-or-url>`; refresh all with `/nase:onboard`
- Change tech news sources, topics, or output sections: edit `workspace/tech-digest-config.md`
- Change identity/language: edit `workspace/config.md` or rerun `/nase:init`
- Change backup retention: edit `backup_retention:` in `workspace/config.md` (e.g. `count:100` or `days:7`)
- Change backup target: edit `backup-target=` in root `.local-paths`

> **Input formats**: `/nase:onboard` accepts Unix/macOS/Windows/Git Bash paths and GitHub URLs. GitHub URLs resolve via `.local-paths`; no clone/network required.
